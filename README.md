### 2. üíª Arduino Sketch Upload
- Connect the Arduino UNO Setup
- Open Arduino IDE.
- Copy-paste the Arduino code into a new sketch.
- Select `Arduino Uno` from Tools > Board.
- Select the correct COM port under Tools > Port.
- Upload the sketch.

### 3. üêç Python Setup

> üêç Python 3.10 or higher is recommended

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install flask vgamepad pyserial

```
- Install ViGEmBus Driver (required for vgamepad on Windows):
  > Download from: ViGEmBus Releases

-Run the installer and complete setup.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Gamepad Emulator

- Run the python file 'gamepad.py'
    
- If you see this output **CONGRATULATIONS!!! CODE IS WORKING**

(IF NOT, MAKE SURE 'COM' PORT IS SAME IN BOTH ARDUINO SKETCH AND PYTHON FILE.)

### üìñ How It Works
The Arduino reads analog joystick and trigger inputs, as well as button states, and sends them as CSV-formatted data via serial.

The Python script reads the data, processes deadzones, filters, and maps it to Xbox controller inputs using the vgamepad library.

The ViGEm driver presents a virtual Xbox 360 controller to the operating system, compatible with most games and emulators.

### üî≠ Future Scope

Add Bluetooth using an HC-05 module

Use an OLED or LCD display for battery or mode info

Add DPAD and Start/Select buttons

Integrate vibration motors

Enclose in a 3D-printed case

Switch to native USB HID using Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro
