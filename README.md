## üöÄ Installation & Setup

### 1. üñºÔ∏è Circuit Diagram

Connect components as follows:

| Component        | Arduino Pin |
|------------------|-------------|
| Left Joystick X  | A0          |
| Left Joystick Y  | A1          |
| Right Joystick X | A2          |
| Right Joystick Y | A3          |
| LT Trigger Axis  | A4          |
| RT Trigger Axis  | A5          |
| Button Y         | 2           |
| Button X         | 3           |
| Button A         | 4           |
| Button B         | 5           |
| LSW (LB)         | 6           |
| RSW (RB)         | 7           |

### 2. üíª Arduino Sketch Upload
- Connect the Arduino UNO Setup
- Open Arduino IDE.
- Copy-paste the Arduino code into a new sketch.
- Select `Arduino Uno` from Tools > Board.
- Select the correct COM port under Tools > Port.
- Upload the sketch.

- **IMPORTANT NOTE: AFTER UPLOADING SKETCH, MUST CLOSE ARDUINO IDE**  
---

### 3. üêç Python Setup

> üêç Python 3.10 or higher is recommended

Install required libraries:

```bash
pip install pyserial vgamepad
```
- Install ViGEmBus Driver (required for vgamepad on Windows):
  > Download from: ViGEmBus Releases

-Run the installer and complete setup.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Gamepad Emulator

- Run the python file 'gamepad.py'
    
- If you see this output **CONGRATULATIONS!!! CODE IS WORKING**

(IF NOT, MAKE SURE 'COM' PORT IS SAME IN BOTH ARDUINO SKETCH AND PYTHON FILE.)

- To CHECK if python code is working open this link.

### üìñ How It Works
The Arduino reads analog joystick and trigger inputs, as well as button states, and sends them as CSV-formatted data via serial.

The Python script reads the data, processes deadzones, filters, and maps it to Xbox controller inputs using the vgamepad library.

The ViGEm driver presents a virtual Xbox 360 controller to the operating system, compatible with most games and emulators.

üî≠ Future Scope
Add Bluetooth using an HC-05 module

Use an OLED or LCD display for battery or mode info

Add DPAD and Start/Select buttons

Integrate vibration motors

Enclose in a 3D-printed case

Switch to native USB HID using Arduino Leonardo or Pro Micro
